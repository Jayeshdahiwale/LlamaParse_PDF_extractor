1. Bold the providerâ€™s name ONLY if it ends with `MD` or `DO` and clearly refers to an individual.

2. Bold the name of any clinic, group, or organization if it includes any of these keywords (case-insensitive)  
   `Center`, `Clinic`, `Health`, `Hospital`, `Group`, `Network`, `Access`, `Medical`, `Care`, `Ltd`, `SC`.

3. Group hierarchy
   - Start a new top-level group when a bolded clinicfacilityorganization name appears.
   - Under it, start a new subgroup every time an address appears.
   - Each address block may include
     - A phone number
     - One or more provider entries
     - Or nothing (just the address and phone)
   - A new address always starts a new subgroup under the same clinicfacility.

4. Provider entries (under addresses) must include
   - Bolded name (if individual MDDO)
   - PCP#
   - Certifications, languages

5. Every element must be on a new line.
   - No blank lines between providers or addresses.
   - Do not bold anything except clinicfacility names and MDDO provider names.
   - Preserve strict Markdown format.

6. Remove all HTML tags, page breaks, Board Certified Provider, dividers like `---`, or irrelevant text.

7. DO NOT extract or include entities that only contain facility words but no address or provider data.
